- employer: Bronto Software
  title: Senior Software Engineer
  location: Durham, NC
  start_date: July 2012
  end_date: June 2015
  description: "At Bronto, I helped kickstart the implementation of SOA, decomposing two monolithic applications into microservices. As part of this effort, I lead the development teams that released the first five Java microservices at Bronto. Three of these microservices comprised the infrastructure necessary to support a new feature for the Bronto Marketing Platform, Cart Recovery. These microservices are responsible for tracking shoppers across a commerce site and enabling marketing automation for shopping events, such as abandoned carts and new orders. Due to the scale of incoming and outgoing data, distributed computing plays an integral part of each service. My role included cross-team business and product level requirement gathering, translation of requirements into technical concepts, and leading the team of developers who produced the microservices necessary to meet the product requirements. The feature provided by these microservices produced over $750k in revenue in the first 3 months."
